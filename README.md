# To Begin

Open each project and look at its readme to run the project yourself.

Both of these projects have the same API format of CRUD operations for a todo app. This todo app allows you to create
users, and todos, and handles the relations between users and todos. View each project's code to get a better feel for
the code and whether your prefer Typeorm or Prisma.
